# Fabric Tensile Tester

My friend gave me a very cool problem prompt:
| How can we procedurally find the Young's Modulus of different fabric weaves

I determined that 3D printed components would have sufficient rigidity and designed the mechanism [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/414844e767a5c5dcc10ecd8a/w/11a8d7078b3e5012b6154466/e/b864a8eacea5f8d32ab57ced?renderMode=0&uiState=6770eccbf48e4208ced637a1)

This is the codebase for procedurally measuring the force required to strain the fabric.
